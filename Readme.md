This is a small Sketch Plugin that estimates the number of characters in a text box.

This is useful for sharing character limits with developers or localisation teams.

Note:
The estimate is calculated very simply, and depends greatly on which languages you are translating this into. This takes a simple calculation that will provide a good estimate.
